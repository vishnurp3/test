POC – Key Updates (Today)

Completed:

Got KT on the migration steps needed for DB configuration.

Created a stored procedure that:

Takes model code as input

Adds questions to the rules table

Creates the new scorecard table

Migrates data from the old table to the new table

Updates the model version table with the new table name


Added a configuration table to track which models can be migrated.

Added a controller in CDF service with two endpoints:

Generates the question template (CSV) for identifying parent questions

Uploads the updated template, calls the stored procedure, and updates the parent question map table


Completed the flow for CRS.


In Progress / To Do (by end of day):

Apply the same flow to CTPA.


Pending / Next Steps:

Get KT on CDF service migration steps to integrate with UI.

Make the required CDF service changes in a configurable way if possible.

Get KT on the migration steps needed for the new calculator framework.

Work on calculator changes in a configurable way if possible.

Need KT on the environment where this POC can be tested with UI integration, and guidance on how deployment will be done.
